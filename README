puppet-modules-puppetlabs package
---------------------------------

This repository contains a Debian package with (some) puppetlabs and 3rdparty puppet modules.
It can be build with

    dpkg-buildpackage

as one would usually expect.

The modules itself can be managed with r10k or librarian-puppet. E.g.

    r10k puppetfile install

will install all modules as listed in the Puppetfile.
